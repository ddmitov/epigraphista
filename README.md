Epigraphista
==================================

Epigraphista is an EpiDoc XML file creator using Perl Executing Browser as a desktop GUI framework, HTML5 and Bootstrap for a themable user interface, JavaScript for on-screen text conversion and Perl5 for file-writing backend. It's language is currently Bulgarian because it is intended, but not limited, to Bulgarian users. Epigraphista could also be used as a server-side application without Perl Executing Browser.
